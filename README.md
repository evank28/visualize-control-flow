# Visualize Control Flow

Want to visualize the control flow of your code? Using this extension, you can generate a diagram that shows the control flow of your code. This is great particularly for students to see their code's logic in a diagram. We use a UML Activity Diagram format, making these diagrams easy to view. Currently supports visualizing control flow of Python code. Actively developed by [@evank28](https://github.com/evank28) and [@AronZeng](https://github.com/AronZeng) as part of #VSCodeHackathon.
